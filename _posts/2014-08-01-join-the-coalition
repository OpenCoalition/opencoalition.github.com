###Join the Open Coalition###
The Coalition is a loose affiliation of organisations and individuals working in
the open space. We welcome anyone who wishes to join us, from every area of the
open sector. Current partners include organisations involved in open source
software, open data, culture, education, policy, human and digital rights,
mapping, cultural heritage, news, open access, citizen science, copyleft, open
research and more.

If you or your organisation are working on open topics, or want to learn how to
include open practices in your daily work, please join us! The best way is to
join our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/open-coalition.)
