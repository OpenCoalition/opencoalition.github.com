###Contact Us###
The Open Coalition has no office - our home is on the Web!
But you can drop us an [email](open-coalition@googlegroups.com) or join the
conversation on Twitter where we are @OpenCoalition.

We hold regular open calls (usually once a month) and everyone is welcome to
join in. Keep an eye on twitter for the details.
